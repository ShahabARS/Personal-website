# Personal website
This is my second project, showcasing an example of a personal website. I did not design the template myself; instead, I used a pre-made layout from another website for practice and to improve my skills. Special thanks to Mr. Ebadi for providing this project as part of the course and for helping correct our mistakes along the way.
